# Genetic algorithm implementation
The application calculates and shows (to console) two results
of of one problem (task about 10 coins) solving. The results are created by two
genetic algorithms(with classic breeding ang breeding by
only mutation), using ranges of algorithms parameters (like
population size etc.). The best result for each algorithm is
selected for showing.
